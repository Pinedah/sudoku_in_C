# Sudoku Game in C

Welcome to the Sudoku Game repository! This project is a simple yet challenging Sudoku game built entirely in the C programming language. The game offers three difficulty levels, allowing players to choose their preferred level of challenge.

## Sudoku Rules

Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids (also called "boxes") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle starts with some cells already filled in, and the difficulty of the puzzle depends on the number of cells initially filled and their arrangement.

### Basic Rules:
1. Each row must contain the digits 1 to 9 without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits 1 to 9 without repetition.
3. Each of the nine 3x3 subgrids must contain the digits 1 to 9 without repetition.

## How to Play

1. **Choose Difficulty**: The game offers three difficulty levelsâ€”easy, medium, and hard. The difficulty level determines the number of pre-filled cells and the complexity of the puzzle.
2. **Fill the Grid**: Using the numbers 1 to 9, fill the empty cells on the grid. Ensure that each number appears only once in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid.
3. **Solve the Puzzle**: Continue filling in numbers until the entire grid is complete. The game will verify if the solution is correct.

## How to Compile and Run

To compile and run the Sudoku game, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sudoku-game.git
    cd sudoku-game
    ```

2. **Compile the Game**:
    ```bash
    gcc -o sudoku sudoku.c
    ```

3. **Run the Game**:
    ```bash
    ./sudoku
    ```

## Note

I built this Sudoku game because I saw my girlfriend, Fatima Nava, playing it once and told her I could build it. This project is dedicated to her and her love for Sudoku.

Enjoy the game!
